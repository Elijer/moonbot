# To Run Moonbot Locally

```bash
cd backend
pipenv shell
pipenv run run
cd ..
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
Then go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see frontend of app.

To see the Django admin console for the backend, got to `http://localhost:7000/admin`

You will probably have to create a Django superUser, like this:
```django
cd backend
pipenv shell
pipenv run su
```
Then enter your user information when prompted.

# To Build Moonbot for Production

## Method 1
Turn off debug variable in `settings.py`.
Then run backend in the same way as in development.
Note that SQLITE will work on a server, but it is not meant for production. It would be a good idea to set up MSQL or Postgres or something. If you end up going the MYSQL route on something like Digital Ocean, Digital Ocean has a great series of tutorial articles on connecting Myseql with Django on a Linux server:

[Digital Ocean: How To Create a Django App and Connect it to a Database](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-django-app-and-connect-it-to-a-database)

For frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run runBuild
```
That should do it! This will create a build folder for you that can be run with the `npx serve -s build` command on a server. It could also be served with an NGINX proxy.

**Note of caution:** If you run the frontend and backend on different servers, they might run into CORS issues. To lazily avoid this, just run them on the same server.

## Method 2
You will notice that there are two docker-compose files in the top level of the moonbot directory:
```bash
docker-compose.dev.yml
docker-compose.prod.yml
```
And also a `Dockerfile` and a `.dockerignore` in both the frontend and backend directories.

# Files and File Structure

The frontend file structure contains a React.js app built with the [create-react-app CLI tool.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started). I have kept their file structure intact, mostly working within the `src` directory.

### `App.js` File
This is the top level component of `moonbot`'s frontend. It includes the arrangement of all data contexts and uses react-router to create the layout and define the routing for the page-views in the app through the `header` component and the page components included in the `pages` folder. It also defines a `404` page to be displayed if the route is outside the route requested is outside the route pattern.

### `.gitignore` File
This git configuration file tells git which files not to track.

### `Dockerfile` File
This file is used by Docker as blueprints that define how to create an image with all of the environmental dependencies and conditions necessary for running the moonbot frontend, as well as running an NGINX server to serve the frontend app.

### `nginx.conf` File
This is the configuration file for NGINX, mostly telling it which files to serve.

### `package-lock.json` File
This file catalogues *all* dependencies, including the dependencies of the top-level dependencies themselves.

### `package.json` File
This is where all top-level npm dependencies are listed with their version numbers.

---

### `frontend/build` Directory
Contains files generated by the `build` command of the `create-react-app` library, which creates a very small bundle of the react project files contained in the `src` and `public` directories.

---

### `frontend/node_modules` Directory
This directory contains all of the dependency packages downloaded form node. Most of them are dependencies to react and create-react-app, but there are a few notable packages that were added specifically for this project:
- `jwt-decode`
- `react-dom`
- `moment`
- `recharts`

---

### `frontend/public` Directory
These are files that will not be minified and bundled, and are included as they are in the build folder when the build command is run. I created the `favicon.ico` file, but not the `index.html` or `manifest.json` files, which were generated by the `create-react-app` CLI tool.

---

### `frontend/src` Directory
This is really the folder where the frontend of `moonbot` was built. It has seven directories:

#### `frontend/src/charts`
stores the chart components used to visualize `moonbot` data on the `Log` page
1. `Rechart_1.js` This component renders a Rechart.js AreaChart component. This is the chart currently fully developed and being used.
2. `Rechart_Linechart_1.js` This is not a fully built component that uses Rechart's LineChart component.

#### `frontend/src/components`
This folder stores miscellaneous components that can be re-used for multiple pages
1. `Header.js`: This component renders the navbar. It is visible on every page of the app, but displays different nav items depending on whether the user is logged in or not.
2. `LogoutFooter.js`: This is a currently un-used componented that renders a logout option at the bottom of any given page. It is not being used because this option exists in the Header component.

#### `frontend/src/context`
This folder stores context-providing components: these components make use of React's
1. `AuthContext.js: This component checks for a JWT user-access token in the browser storage, and if one exists, it attempts to log that user in using the authentication routes in the backend. It also handles the authentication and browser-storage for manually logging in and logging out. Additionally, it updates the access and refresh tokens at given interavls to keep them fresh as long as the user token is actively being used.
2. `Config.js`: The concept for this component was to keep configuration variables in their own dedicated space. The only variable that ended up being necesssary so far is the serverURL variable, which stores the address and port number by which the backend can be accessed. All HTTP requests throughout the front-end should make use of this contextual variable.
3. `RequestContext.js`: This context component was designed to reduce un-DRY HTTP requests that are made in the same way across multiple components. So far this includes the `updateEntry` and `updateSettings` methods, which are each used by more than one component. The pattern of storing a re-useable HTTP requests inside of a context component is that although HTTP requests within `moonbot` often have many contextual dependencies, like the app's `time` object, the `user` object and the `config` context, as well as many react and other imports, they can be used by other components with just one import and one line of usage, drastically reducing the amount of code and reducing the complexity of the dependency web.
4. 'TimeContext`: moonbot is a heavily time-reliant app. Time is frequently parsed, interpreted and used in database queries throughout the app. The time context gets the time once, parses it into several forms, and then allows access to that same information through the app.

#### `frontend/src/images`
Two background jpeg images are used by `moonbot`. They are stored here. There is `pink_sky.jpeg' and 'snowy_moon.jpeg', which are used by the `LoginPage` and the 'RegisterPage' components, respectively.

#### `frontend/src/pages`
this is where components that render an entire page are stored. It is also worth noting that `pages` contains a `Tracker` subdirectory. This subdirectory is where all of the sub-components for the `Tracker.js` component are stored.
1. `Log.js`: This component renders the content of the `/_log` route, where user data is rendered into a Recharts.js area graph.
2. `LoginPage.js`: This page is where the user logs in.
4. `NotFound.js`: This is a 404 page that is rendered when the user navigates to a route outside of the url pattern.
5. 'RegisterPage.js`: This page is where the user can register a new account.
6. `SettingsPage.js`: This page allows the user to customize which mood tracking components they see on the main page. The user can choose to see all or none of them. This page includes one component that does not exist yet: the outside tracker.
7. `Tracker.js`: This is the main page displayed to a logged-in user, and the hotspot of functionality in the app. It contains several data-input/data-display components that are included in the `frontend/src/Pages/Tracker` subdirectory. These components all have a similar structure but a different purpose. Each component checks to see if data has been input into one of their fields that day (or in the case of the energy tracker, that _part_ of the day). If so, they show that data has been rendered with the placeholder value or with backround color. Regardless, they also have handlers that listen for changes and log them to the database if the new information is valid. Note that none of these components are actually responsible for querying existing data from the database, which is actually passed down to them through props from `Tracker.js`. It turns out that in order to render data from props when a component is initialized, props must be saved to state inside ofa useEffect block with the props object listed in the dependency array, as props data is actually _not_ available when the component renders for the first time. Tracker.js makes a request to the `getEntry` route from the backend.
---

#### `frontend/src/pages/Tracker`
1. `BCInput.js`: This component renders a grid of 28 days and is designed to help the user keep keep track of which birth control pill was taken on which day. Similar to the other tracker components.
2. `CryInput.js`: This component renders a number and a plus and minus button on either side of it used to increase or decrease the number.
3. `EnergyInput.js: This component renders three buttons that represent three different energy levels: `little`, `some`, and `lots`.
4. `SleepInput.js`: Although it is visually small, this is the most complex of the tracker components. It has four inputs: sleepTime, wakeTime, sleepDomain and wakeDomain. The `domain` fields represent the am or pm value of the wake and sleep times. This component relies on the `formatTime` helper function imported from `frontend/src/utilities/utilities.js` to reformat user input and prevent them from entering characters that would represent non-existant or innacurate times. Note: this custom helper function is very logically complex and might be replaced by a tested and existing method from a trusted time-formatting library.
5. `TimeDisplay.js`: This component is not like the others in this folder, but it lives here because like them, it is also used by the tracker component. The `TimeDisplay` compenent asks the `TimeContext` provider what time it is and uses that information to render the date and time on the top right and left corners of the screen underneath the header component.

#### `frontend/src/pages`
this is where all style files are stored, except for the entry-level `App.scss` file, which loads all files in this directory.

#### `frontend/src/utilities`
This folder stores helpful functions and components that have a broad function needed in certain pages or components.

# Ports
- Django port: `7000`
- React Port: `3000`
- In react, change port by changing an environmental variable: `export PORT=9000`
- In django, go into Pipfile and change `run` command to reflect desired port.
- If you change the port serving Django, you will also need to reflect that in the `serverURL` variable found here: `frontend/src/context/Config.js`

<br>
<br>

# REACT
The frontend was created with React, specifically through the file structure produced by the `create-react-app` [CLI tool.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)

<br>

# DJANGO

In the top directory of moonbot, there should be a yaml file for Insomnia nd a txt file for Postman. These are HTTP request testing/viewing programs. I think in the end I like Insomnia's simplicity. I highly recommend looking at the routes in one of these programs in order to smoothly use the Django API.

<br>
<br>

# To Do

1. A bit of styling and style file organization refactoring
2. Create tests
3. Dockerize
4. Create tool for selecting mood tracker components
5. Set up twilio, possibly with geolocation?
6. Clear out unused code in backend AND frontend
7. create data visualization / data consumption tools (probably on its own page)

# Problems
1. The background images for the Login and Register pages will not display in production build (but no problem in development build). The developer-tools say that they are requested successfully, `200 OK`. I've tried loading them many different ways.

# Potential Problems

1. Since all data is just input whenever it changes, if there are ANY artifacts, like an initial state, that is exposed to set the state somehow, it is likely it will also be able to change the data in the database, permanently erasing user data for the field in question. I have run into this problem in CryInput and BCInput and fixed it by created a userInteraction boolean with useState that just determines if the user has HAD any valid interaction as a prequisite for sending any http updates requests.

2. I'm not returning anything from the updateEntry callback, like data that gets rendered or *not* rendered. So each input component just sort of assumes success, and if it fails for some reason, then there's no indication to the user that anything bad has happened. I think that I need to make the function a promise (which I think it already is? Or possibly, return a promise that is saved to a data variable, so that I can do any renders to the HTML using whatever data it returns, namely NOT setting the background to buttons if pressing them didn't succeed in sending the data to the database.

3. Put more succinctly, UI state is changing based on HTTP requests, not responses. It should be the other way around.

4. Making multiple entries for the same datestring -- this may be happening. Find out if it is and make sure this does not happen.

5. Time input is very convoluted, mostly on this logic -- there are 4 fields sent back and forth,
- sleep
- wake
- sleepDomain
- wakeDomain

But there could be just 2 passed back and forth, which would minimize all sorts of annoying complexity. The trick is settling on a format that both python and javascript are happy with, and committing to a similar time library to use for both frontend and backend. But there's nothing wrong with it, it's just overly complicated.

# Note on create-react-app React Linting Debug Messages

The eslint warnings were really getting to me. Mostly about things left out of dependency arrays and imports that I wasn't using. Many of which were not very important during the current moment. I disabled them. To re-enable them, go to `package.json` and add this block after the `scripts` section:
```json
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": [
      "react-app",
      "react-app/jest"
    ]
  },
```
